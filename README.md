## Fun with Random.org
This challenge is programming language agnostic! Pick whichever language you're most comfortable with. Random.org is a web front-end to an atmospheric noise sensor, which can give us pretty good random numbers. It's the reverse from a noise cancelling filter, since it cancels everything BUT the noise. Weather conditions, solar flares, a full-moon can have little impact on this, since it focuses on getting the purest white noise possible from their hardware sensors. If you too think this is cool, you'd be thrilled to try our challenge:

1. Using the HTTP API for random.org (https://www.random.org/clients/http/) we will ask you to get truly random numbers. Look out for the guidelines, or you may get banned!

2. Using these random numbers create:

- An RSA key pair (We would discourage you from implementing your own textbook keypair implementation based on exponents and GCD, 100 points)
